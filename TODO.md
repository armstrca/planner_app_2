# To Do

## Mandatory ASAP

- TLDRaw is now implemented, but need to make sure regular typing functionality of original setup is preserved
- Figure out what the models even are, NBD
- Blank template pages with drag and drop options
- User profiles
- Automatically save all user input
- Be able to draw/write on top of anything, including existing text areas
- Each calendar cell needs to function as a link to that day's weekly or daily page, allow for event creation, and show existing events
- Need code to be modular to allow for a full year's worth of content, especially for daily pages, but storage and memory have to be as light as possible
- Figure out if daily & weekly pages are gonna actually definitely be made out of HTML & React & such or if they're partially gonna be fancy SVGs or what

## Next level

- Mini calendars must be fully functional
- Ingest external calendars
- Preset template options
- Text recognition for handwriting
- Turn handwriting into events
- Toolbar for inputs
- Heavy duty responsiveness stuff
- What if user wants to differentiate between mouse/touch/stylus interaction?
- UI accessibility, general accessibility

## Later

- Eventually allow users to share their own templates
- Eventually allow users to create extensions/add-ons
- Notifications for events/whatever
- View format options - weekly pages side-by-side, vertical, etc.
- Be able to show/hide toolbars/menus, etc.
